Please create a game level of the famous NES videogame Flappy (1983) using ASCII characters inside a 17x13 ASCII matrix following the next rules:
ASCII representations of the objects in the game:
- The main character Flappy will be represented by the letter 'F'.
- The enemies will be represented with the letter 'U' for each Unicorn and the letter 'E' for each Ebira.
- The brown stones correspond to the letter 'P'.
- The blue stone will be represented with the letter 'A' and the blue platform with the letter 'X'.
- The mushrooms will be represented by the letter 'H'.
- Bricks, which will form the walls and floors, will be represented with the character '='.
- Everything that is not an object will be Void and will be represented with a space, the character ' '.

Flappy Level Generation Rules:
- The matrix boundaries will be represented as bricks.
- All objects and characters must be represented within the boundaries.
- Flappy, the blue stone and the blue platform must appear.
- Flappy, the blue stone and the blue platform can only appear once in the whole matrix. 
- Enemies, brown stones, mushrooms and bricks can exist several or none.
- Flappy will always be represented in the upper left corner of the matrix, within the boundaries.
- Flappy cannot appear surrounded by bricks that impede his movement.
- To create a wall, several bricks will be used in a row, the walls can have any extension within the matrix, but in no case can they occupy the entire length or width of the matrix.
- The brown stones will be generated on a brick or on another brown stone, but never on another type of object or Void.
- The blue stone will be generated on a brick or on a brown stone, but never on another type of object or Void.
- Mushrooms can only appear on a brick.
- The blue platform can never have stones or bricks on top of it.

To make the generated level playable the Flappy game rules are defined, use them to create coherent levels that allow a satisfactory game experience:
The main objective is for the main character Flappy to move the blue stone from its starting position to the target blue platform in each level.

Move the blue stone:
- You can push the blue stone from the left or from the right.
- You cannot push the bluestone if it is blocked by an obstacle (brick wall, another stone, etc.).
- You cannot move the blue stone if it is in a gap where there is no room to push it.

Enemies:
- Unicorns move horizontally in repetitive patterns.
- Ebira (crab enemies) chase Flappy both horizontally and vertically, mimicking his movements.
- Sleepy mushrooms can be picked up and thrown to temporarily stun enemies.
- Stones can be dropped on enemies to permanently eliminate them.

Obstacles and Terrain:
- Brick walls: You can only go around them, never through them.
- Brown stones: Can be crushed if Flappy pushes them in a direction they can't go, if any fall on Flappy, he loses a life.
- Gaps or dead angles: If the blue stone falls into one, it becomes unrecoverable, and the level must be restarted.
- You cannot push more than one object at a time.


Now that you know the rules for generating Flappy levels, create a level that also meets these specific conditions:
- Many brown rocks should appear, at least 4.
- No enemies should appear.


Here I show some examples of levels to help you, but none of them can be repeated or copied:
